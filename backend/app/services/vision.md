## Custodian

Custodian is an experiment in personal AI ownership.

Today, intelligence is powerful but fragmented. Models are smart, but memory lives elsewhere. Context is temporary. Identity is reconstructed on every prompt. Over time, pieces of you end up scattered across providers, logs, and opaque systems you don’t control.

Custodian explores a different idea.

What if your memory, preferences, and long-term context belonged to you, not the model?
What if intelligence was something you connected to, rather than something that absorbed you?

Custodian exists as a user-owned layer that sits beside models, not inside them. It holds memory. It runs agents. It decides what is remembered, what is forgotten, and what is shared. Models come and go; Custodian remains.

This opens up possibilities:

Agents that act on your behalf without exporting your identity

Long-running sub-agents that remember why they exist

Local execution, private skills, and personal workflows

Intelligence that adapts over time without centralising control

A future where switching models doesn’t mean starting over

Custodian is not trying to be the smartest system in the room.
It’s trying to be the most trustworthy one.

A quiet constant.
A boundary.
A place where intelligence can grow — without being owned.


## Conceptual Overview

Custodian sits alongside intelligence, not above it.

Models provide capability.
Custodian provides continuity.

Intelligence becomes something you interface with, not something that absorbs your history.

What Custodian Is Not

Custodian is intentionally limited in what it tries to be.

It is not a model

It does not train on your data

It is not a chat UI

It does not try to replace existing tools

It is not a platform that locks you in

Custodian doesn’t compete with models.
It outlives them.

## Design Principles

These principles guide every decision in Custodian, even when it’s inconvenient.

User memory is sovereign
Memory belongs to the user. Full stop.

Models are replaceable
Intelligence should be portable, not coupled.

Explicit over implicit
Remembering, forgetting, and acting should be intentional.

Local first, extensible always
Start private. Grow outward by choice.

Quiet power
The most important systems don’t demand attention.

## The Long View

Custodian is not a product roadmap.
It’s a direction.

A future where:

AI systems can act without harvesting identity

Agents can persist without central ownership

Intelligence becomes personal infrastructure

Custodian is a place to explore that future — carefully.

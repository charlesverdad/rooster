# Rooster - Pre-Production Bug Report & Issues

## Testing performed as: charles@church.com (Team Lead)

---

## BUGS

### 1. Negative Day Count Display
- **Location**: Home page, Upcoming Assignments section
- **Issue**: Past assignments show "In -5 days" instead of being hidden or showing "5 days ago"
- **Expected**: Past assignments should either be hidden from "Upcoming" or display properly (e.g., "5 days ago")

### 2. Pluralization Error
- **Location**: My Teams page
- **Issue**: Shows "1 members" instead of "1 member" for teams with single member
- **Expected**: Correct grammar - "1 member" (singular)

### 3. Add Member Dialog - Button Not Responsive (Potential Bug)
- **Location**: Team Detail > Add Member dialog
- **Issue**: The "Add" button in the Add Member dialog did not respond to clicks
- **Notes**: Could be a Flutter web rendering issue or actual bug - needs manual verification

## UI/UX OBSERVATIONS

### 1. Test Data Visible
- Rosters named "asdfadf" visible in production-ready state
- Should clean up test data before go-live

### 2. Past Assignments in "Upcoming" Section
- Member profile (test 6) shows "Mon, Feb 2" as an upcoming assignment when today is Jan 31, 2026
- These should be filtered out or moved to a "Past" section

### 3. Large Number of Unfilled Slots
- 56 unfilled slots showing in "Needs Attention"
- May want to paginate or collapse this for better UX

---

## POSITIVE OBSERVATIONS

- Clean, simple login page design
- Good use of icons (church icon branding)
- Clear team/member hierarchy
- Placeholder member concept well-implemented (envelope icon distinction)
- "Needs Attention" section helpful for team leads
- Quick assign buttons (+ Assign) easily accessible
